## Overview
This repository contains some functions and classes we kept reusing when we worked as Research Assistants at Columbia University Taub Institue. We intentionally made these scripts perfectly executable in Linux command line.

As of September 2020, this repository is more or less a self-documentation. We will soon update it and get it more readily usable for the public.
